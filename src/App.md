## ‚ö° **Application Structure & Features**
The frontend is built using **SolidJS**, designed with modularity, scalability, and responsiveness in mind. It leverages:
* **SolidJS Router** for client-side routing with nested layouts.
* **Context Providers**:

  * `ThemeProvider` for light/dark theme management.
  * `AuthProvider` for authentication state and access control.
* **Protected Routes**:

  * Uses `<ProtectedRoute>` for safeguarding sensitive pages (e.g., dashboard, editor).
* **Dynamic Layout**:

  * Reusable `Layout` component with configurable header, footer, and navigation.
  * Supports fallback loading indicators via `Suspense`.
* **Global Services**:

  * `Toaster` for notifications.
  * `Modal` service for dialog management.

## üöÄ **Additional Features**

* **Code Splitting**: Routes wrapped in `<Suspense>` for optimized loading.
* **Mobile & Desktop Ready**: Tailwind-based design for responsive layout.
* **Modal and Notification Services**: Modular services accessible throughout the app.
* **Environment-Aware**: Uses `import.meta.env` variables for API URLs and runtime configs.

## üìù **Additional Notes**

* All protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.
* The layout structure can easily accommodate additional headers, sidebars, or footers.
* Error handling is centralized at the route/component level.
* Consider adding **lazy loading** for components to further improve performance.
* Extendable with additional routes or providers with minimal changes.
