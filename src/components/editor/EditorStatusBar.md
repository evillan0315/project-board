# EditorStatusBar Component Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the `EditorStatusBar` component, including its purpose, functionality, dependencies, and usage.

## Overview

The `EditorStatusBar` component is a UI element that displays information about the currently open file in the editor.  It shows the file name, programming language, and save status (whether there are unsaved changes). It leverages the `@nanostores/solid` library for state management and `solid-js`'s `createMemo` for reactive computations.

## Functionality

The `EditorStatusBar` performs the following functions:

*   **Displays File Name:** Extracts and displays the file name from the file path stored in the `editorFilePath` store. If no file is open, it displays "No file open".
*   **Displays Programming Language:** Displays the programming language associated with the currently open file, retrieved from the `editorLanguage` store. If no language is specified, it displays "N/A".
*   **Displays Save Status:**  Indicates whether the currently open file has unsaved changes based on the `editorUnsaved` store.  It dynamically displays "Unsaved Changes" (in red if changes exists) or "No changes.".  If no file is open, it displays "No file".

## Dependencies

The `EditorStatusBar` component relies on the following dependencies:

*   **`@nanostores/solid`:**  Used for connecting to and observing changes in stores. Specifically, the `useStore` hook is used to access the values of `editorFilePath`, `editorLanguage`, and `editorUnsaved` stores.
*   **`solid-js`:**  The underlying JavaScript framework. Specifically the `createMemo` is used to create derived signals that are automatically updated when their dependencies change.
*   **`../../stores/editorContent`:** This module (relative path) contains the following stores:
    *   **`editorFilePath`:** A nanostores store that holds the file path of the currently open file.
    *   **`editorLanguage`:** A nanostores store that holds the programming language of the currently open file.
    *   **`editorUnsaved`:** A nanostores store that tracks whether there are unsaved changes for each file. It is expected to be a store containing a map/object where keys are file paths and values are booleans representing whether there are unsaved changes for that file.

## Code Breakdown

```javascript
import { useStore } from '@nanostores/solid';
import { createMemo } from 'solid-js';
import { editorFilePath, editorLanguage, editorUnsaved } from '../../stores/editorContent';

export const EditorStatusBar = () => {
  const $filePath = useStore(editorFilePath);
  const $language = useStore(editorLanguage);
  const $unsaved = useStore(editorUnsaved);
  
  // Use createMemo to compute fileName reactively
  const fileName = createMemo(() => {
    const path = $filePath();
    return path ? path.split('/').pop() : '';
  });

  // Compute status reactively
  const status = createMemo(() => {
    const path = $filePath();
    if (!path) return 'No file';
    return $unsaved()[path] ? 'Unsaved Changes' : 'No changes.';
  });

  return (
    <div class="flex items-center justify-between gap-3 text-xs px-2">
      <div class="truncate max-w-[200px]" title={$filePath() || 'No file open'}>
        File: {fileName() || 'No file open'}
    
      </div>
      <div>Language: {$language() || 'N/A'}</div>
      <div class={status() === 'Unsaved Changes' ? 'text-red-500' : ''}>Status: {status()}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Explanation

1.  **Imports:**
    *   `useStore` from `@nanostores/solid`: This hook allows the component to subscribe to changes in the nanostores and re-render when the store values update.
    *   `createMemo` from `solid-js`: This function creates a memoized reactive value. The provided function is only re-executed when its dependencies (signals accessed within the function) change.  This optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary re-calculations.
    *   `editorFilePath`, `editorLanguage`, `editorUnsaved` from `../../stores/editorContent`: These are the nanostores that hold the editor's state.

2.  **`EditorStatusBar` Component:**
    *   **`useStore` Hooks:**
        *   `const $filePath = useStore(editorFilePath);`: Subscribes to the `editorFilePath` store. `$filePath` is now a signal (Solid's reactive primitive) that holds the current file path.  Calling `$filePath()` will return the current value.
        *   `const $language = useStore(editorLanguage);`: Subscribes to the `editorLanguage` store. `$language` is a signal holding the current programming language. Calling `$language()` will return the current value.
        *   `const $unsaved = useStore(editorUnsaved);`: Subscribes to the `editorUnsaved` store. `$unsaved` is a signal representing the unsaved changes state. Calling `$unsaved()` will return current map/object.

    *   **`createMemo` for `fileName`:**
        *   `const fileName = createMemo(() => { ... });`: Creates a memoized signal named `fileName`.
        *   `const path = $filePath();`:  Reads the current value of the `editorFilePath` store.
        *   `return path ? path.split('/').pop() : '';`: Extracts the file name from the path by splitting the path string by `/` and taking the last element (using `pop()`). If `path` is empty or null, it returns an empty string.
        *   This ensures the filename is efficiently computed only when the `editorFilePath` store changes.

    *   **`createMemo` for `status`:**
        *   `const status = createMemo(() => { ... });`: Creates a memoized signal named `status`.
        *   `const path = $filePath();`:  Reads the current value of the `editorFilePath` store.
        *   `if (!path) return 'No file';`: If there's no file path, sets the status to "No file".
        *   `return $unsaved()[path] ? 'Unsaved Changes' : 'No changes.';`: Checks if the file has unsaved changes by accessing `$unsaved()` (which returns the object from the store) and then indexing it with the current `path`. Returns appropriate message depending on the boolean value.
        *   Again, memoization ensures efficient re-calculation only when necessary.

    *   **JSX Structure (Return Value):**
        *   The component returns a `div` element that acts as the status bar.
        *   **File Name Display:**
            *   `<div class="truncate max-w-[200px]" title={$filePath() || 'No file open'}>`: This div displays the file name.
                *   `class="truncate max-w-[200px]"`:  Applies CSS classes to truncate the file name if it's too long and sets a maximum width.
                *   `title={$filePath() || 'No file open'}`: Sets the title attribute of the div to the full file path (or "No file open" if there's no file path).  This allows the user to see the full path on hover.
                *   `File: {fileName() || 'No file open'}`: Displays the file name.
        *   **Language Display:**
            *   `<div>Language: {$language() || 'N/A'}</div>`: Displays the programming language.
        *   **Status Display:**
            *   `<div class={status() === 'Unsaved Changes' ? 'text-red-500' : ''}>Status: {status()}</div>`: Displays the save status.
                *   `class={status() === 'Unsaved Changes' ? 'text-red-500' : ''}`:  Dynamically applies the `text-red-500` CSS class if the status is "Unsaved Changes", making the status text red.

## Usage

To use the `EditorStatusBar` component:

1.  Ensure that `@nanostores/solid` and `solid-js` are installed as dependencies in your project.

2.  Make sure the `editorFilePath`, `editorLanguage`, and `editorUnsaved` stores are properly defined and managed in the `../../stores/editorContent` module.

3.  Import the `EditorStatusBar` component into your desired location:

    ```javascript
    import { EditorStatusBar } from './EditorStatusBar';
    ```

4.  Render the component within your SolidJS application:

    ```javascript
    <EditorStatusBar />
    ```

## Props

This component does not accept any props. It directly consumes data from the nanostores.

## Store Requirements

The `editorFilePath`, `editorLanguage`, and `editorUnsaved` stores must be correctly initialized and updated for the `EditorStatusBar` component to function properly.

*   **`editorFilePath`:** Should hold a string representing the full path to the opened file.  An empty string or `null` indicates no file is open.

*   **`editorLanguage`:** Should hold a string representing the programming language of the opened file (e.g., "javascript", "python", "markdown").  An empty string or `null` indicates the language is unknown.

*   **`editorUnsaved`:** This store is expected to hold an object (or similar data structure) where keys are the file paths and values are booleans indicating if that file has unsaved changes. For example:

    ```javascript
    {
        '/path/to/file1.js': true,  // file1.js has unsaved changes
        '/path/to/file2.py': false   // file2.py has no unsaved changes
    }
    ```

## Example

Assuming the stores are properly set up, the `EditorStatusBar` component would display something like this:

*   **When a file is open and has no unsaved changes:**

    `File: myfile.js  Language: javascript  Status: No changes.`

*   **When a file is open and has unsaved changes:**

    `File: myfile.js  Language: javascript  Status: Unsaved Changes` (in red)

*   **When no file is open:**

    `File: No file open  Language: N/A  Status: No file`
```
