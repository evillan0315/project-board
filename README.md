## 🚀 Features Overview

### 🌐 Frontend Architecture

The frontend is powered by **SolidJS**, featuring:

- Client-side routing with protected and public paths.
- Context-based theme and authentication management.
- A dynamic layout system that supports global header, footer, and modal services.
- Code-splitting and lazy-loading ready (via `Suspense`).

#### 📂 Main Routes
- `/` → Public home
- `/login` → Authentication
- `/dashboard` → User dashboard (protected)
- `/editor` → Markdown/code editor (protected)

#### 🛠 Built-in Services
- **Toaster** → Real-time notifications.
- **Modal** → Centralized modal service.
- **SocketIO integration** → For streaming downloads & real-time updates.

> ⚠️ _All sensitive routes are guarded. Ensure API endpoints are secured on the backend as well._
